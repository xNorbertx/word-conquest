# Implementation and verification — 29 September 2026

## Delivered locally

- Root prototype preserved. Separate online web app with Autumn Sunday typography,
  palette, ownership symbols, keyboard selection, joker inputs, score preview, narrow
  layout and board enlargement. A visual-only preview is explicitly labelled.
- Supabase migration and deployed-function source: verified Auth identity, participant
  access, service-only writes, row locking, revision compare-and-swap, actor-bound
  operation receipts, transactionally saved state and inbox events.
- Server validates paths, dictionary, capture limits and turn order; computes points,
  ownership and replacement letters. Secure server randomness. No client scores used.
- Licensed, hashed dictionary snapshot and frozen v1 engine/rules. Existing prototype
  rules and all original engine files are untouched.
- Persistent client pending actions with stable retry IDs, stale-board reload, focus/
  reconnect/visible polling, invitation links/codes, expiry/accept/decline/cancel,
  account login/confirmation/recovery UI, names, lists, recaps and full move history.
- Resignation, mutual draws, unranked 30-day abandonment; grouped completed-game stats;
  inbox/preferences; isolated retrying Resend email function; data export and deletion
  with recent-auth check, account revocation and shared-history anonymization.
- Rate/request limits, active-game cap, RLS/grants, log redaction, operational runbook,
  single owner setup checklist and privacy policy draft. Reuse existing Resend + Zoho.
- Web/function builds and generated/synchronized Android Capacitor project. Native
  directories are ignored; no signing credentials or public store submission.

## Verification completed

- Three original rule/scoring/supply test programs pass.
- PostgreSQL migration executed in PGlite; integration tests check participant RLS,
  service-only grants, invite races/retries, exactly one receipt/inbox event per turn,
  stale rejection, lost-response retry, a complete game reloaded from SQL every turn,
  lifecycle and deletion behavior.
- Server tests cover actor spoofing, wrong turns, illegal words, client score injection,
  rules mismatch, missing dictionary, input bounds and authentication/origin rejection.
- Notification tests cover secret enforcement, opt-out, failure retry, stable provider
  idempotency and bounded delivery window. No real email sent.
- Browser preview inspected on desktop and narrow viewport; keyboard selection and
  joker input exercised. No horizontal document overflow observed on narrow layout.
- Package audit after updating Capacitor to 7.6.9 reports zero known vulnerabilities.

## Explicitly incomplete / release gates

- No Supabase project/access or real sender credentials supplied; backend is **not
  deployed**. PGlite is real local PostgreSQL but does not substitute for hosted Auth,
  PostgREST, Edge runtime, network concurrency or SMTP verification.
- No hosted two-account acceptance/confirmation/recovery, interrupted HTTP submission,
  cross-device session recovery or multi-day playtest yet. Need actual project and sender.
- No staging URL verified or deployed; GitHub remote exists, authenticated hosting
  access was not found. No push or Pages setting change made.
- No configured Cron, external monitor, backup job, restore drill or retention job.
- Owner support/operator identity and privacy/retention approval remain outstanding.
- No APK/IPA compiled, no signing, no physical-device testing. Android SDK absent;
  installed Java is 19, so a supported build JDK is also required. iOS needs Mac/Xcode. Native deep links, secure token-storage review and APNs/FCM
  are mobile release work; web links currently remain in the web app.
- No public matchmaking/messaging, therefore their conditional moderation milestone
  is not launched. No public app-store release authorized.

The first-online milestone must remain unaccepted until the remote and real-device
checks above pass. Local implementation completion is not release acceptance.
